# Twitch-Spotify Bot

Control your Spotify player through your Twitch chat

## Available commands:
| Command | Cooldown | Description |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| !song / !playing | 10 seconds | Info about the currently playing song |
| !play <songname> | 2.5 seconds | Plays the provided song now |
| !queue <songname> | 2.5 seconds | Enqueues the provided song |
| !volume <1-100> | 2.5 seconds | Changes the volume (number is in percent) |

| !shuffle <on/off> | 2.5 seconds | Enables/disables shuffling |
| !repeat <on/off> | 2.5 seconds | Enables/disables repeating |

Words in `<>`'s are necessary and need to be added to the command. Replace `<songname>` with the actual name of the song you want to use.<br>
When trying to play/enqueue a new song, try to provide the artist's name (in case there are multiple songs with the same name), so you play/enqueue the correct song.<br>
All commands except for `!song` are only available to moderators and the streamer.<br>
Make sure to give mod perms to beatz41 (`/mod beatz41`), so the bot is always able to send messages.
